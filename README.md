# WebAuthFinal
The website wont work locally due to the anchors not having .html at the end
This was done to make the website appear more professional
I used express to serve static html web pages without the .html at the end

Improvements to be Made
=
- Cleaner CSS/HTML
- Better database structure
- Actual Authentication
- Cancel Purchase
- More Destinations
